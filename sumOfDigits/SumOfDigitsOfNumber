You are required to write a Java program to calculate the sum of the digits of a given positive number 'n'.

Your program should prompt the user to enter a positive number 'n', read the input using the Scanner class, and then calculate and display the sum of its digits.

For example:

If the user enters the number 123, your program should calculate and print "Sum Of Digits Of a Number 123 is: 1 2 3" and the sum of digits as 6 (1 + 2 + 3).
