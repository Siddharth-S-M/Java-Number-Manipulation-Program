You are required to write a Java program to calculate and print the reverse of a given positive integer 'n'.

Your program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer 'n', read the input using the Scanner class, and then calculate and display the reverse of the number.

For example:

If the user enters the number 12345, your program should calculate and print "Reverse Number is: 54321" as the reverse of 12345 is 54321.
