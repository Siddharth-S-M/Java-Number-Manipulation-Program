write a Java program that determines whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number or pluperfect digital invariant) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

For example:

The number 153 is an Armstrong number because (1^3) + (5^3) + (3^3) = 153.
The number 9474 is an Armstrong number because (9^4) + (4^4) + (7^4) + (4^4) = 9474.
The number 123 is not an Armstrong number because (1^3) + (2^3) + (3^3) = 36, which is not equal to 123.
