You are required to write a Java program to calculate the sum of squares of natural numbers from 1 to a given positive integer 'n'.

Your program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer 'n', read the input using the Scanner class, and then calculate and display the sum of squares of natural numbers from 1 to 'n'.

For example:

If the user enters the number 5, your program should calculate and print "Sum Of Squares from 1 to 5 is: 1 4 9 16 25" as the sum of squares of natural numbers from 1 to 5 is 55 (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25).
