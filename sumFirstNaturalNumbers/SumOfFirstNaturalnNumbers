You are required to write a Java program to calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given positive integer 'n'.

Your program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer 'n', read the input using the Scanner class, and then calculate and display the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to 'n'.

For example:

If the user enters the number 5, your program should calculate and print "All natural numbers till 5 are: 1 2 3 4 5" as the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 5 is 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5).
