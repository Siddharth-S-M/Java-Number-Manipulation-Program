You are required to write a Java program to find and print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two given positive integers n1 and n2. 
The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both n1 and n2 without leaving a remainder.

Your program should take two positive integers n1 and n2 as input and then calculate and display the GCD of the two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

For example:

If the user enters n1 as 36 and n2 as 48, your program should calculate and print the GCD as 12.
